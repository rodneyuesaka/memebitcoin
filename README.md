# ‚è≥ Halving & Release Logic

The entire supply is minted to the contract address upon deployment and is released periodically via the releaseTokens() function.

- Release Cycle: The token release amount is halved every 122 days (approx. 4 months).
- Start Time: The schedule begins on 2025-10-31 00:00:00 UTC.
- Functionality: The releaseTokens() function transfers the scheduled amount from the locked contract balance to the designated distributionContract address.

# ü™ô Claim & Distribution Logic

The Claim Smart Contract receives the tokens released from the main Token Contract. This contract is responsible for managing the final distribution to end-users.

This process involves two steps:

1. Assignment (Eligibility): A user's wallet address is designated as eligible to claim a specific amount of tokens. This eligibility is recorded in the contract's on-chain ledger (claimableTokens mapping). This step credits the user's account with a claimable balance but does not transfer any tokens yet.

2. Claim (User Action): The user initiates the claimTokens(uint256 amount) function. The contract verifies the user's claimable balance (from Step 1) and, if sufficient, transfers the requested amount of MBTC to their wallet.

# üìù Check-in Logic
The Check-in Smart Contract is a separate utility contract designed to record user activity.

- **Purpose:** It allows users to execute a checkIn() transaction daily (or per a specific cooldown period). This action records their lastCheckIn timestamp on-chain.

- **Functionality:** This on-chain activity (via the UserCheckedIn event) is monitored by an off-chain service. This service is responsible for calculating rewards for user engagement (e.g., "checked in 7 days in a row").

- **Connection**: Once rewards are calculated, the service calls the assignTokens() function in the Claim Smart Contract to credit the user's account.
